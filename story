One day when a monkey was climbing a tree in the forest in which he lived, he ran a thorn into his tail
Try as he would, he could not get it out, so he went to a barber in the town and said: ... The barber could not put back the end of the monkey's tail, so he gave him his razor.
On the way home the monkey met an old woman who was cutting wood for fuel, and he said to her:

"Grandmother, Grandmother, that is very hard. Use this razor and then it will cut easily."
